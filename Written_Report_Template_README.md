# Kickstarting with Excel(Module 1)

## Overview of Project
The main objective of the project was to find out how the fund raising goals fared against the outcomes of different campaigns/projects.


### Purpose
Find the outcome of the theater show status based on the launch date and plot it. Also identify the percentage of success, failure and cancellations based on the goals and then plot them on a line graph.  

## Analysis and Challenges

I started off first trying to understand the question and the dataset provided, familiarizing myself with the datsset. 
Then I began with understanding what was being asked and I started breaking down the problem into smaller parts until it cannot be broken down further. 
Then I addressed the smaller bits of problems one by one and then combining the solutions to form the complete solution. 


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
I could see that the number of successful theater shows was in the month of May and the lowest successful shows was in the month of December. The most probable cause can be because of the holidays and winter season. People did not go out that much. 
The failed shows gradually increased and then declined between July to September. Its the summer season and people prefer to go out so failed shows reduced. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
The success and failed shows are inversely related. Whenever success outcome increases, failed outcome decreases and vice versa. 


### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Putting multiple conditions on COUNTIFS() function. 
Could not place percentage symbol on the vertical axis of the graph


## Results


- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
There was an increase in success rate between March and May. A gradual decrease after that. 
The highest success was in the month of May.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
There is no data for canceled shows
There is a variable outcome for successful and failed plays. Successful plays reduces as goals increase. 
Successful and failed plays are inversely related. 


- What are some limitations of this dataset?
There was no data available for the canceled plays

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
A graph with similarities to plays like drama, television, etc. and then performing a comparison that shows whether plays are popular or television and movies are.
